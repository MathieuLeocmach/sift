\begin{abstract}
We propose a scale-space based method to extract both the individual 3D coordinates and the radii of spherical colloids from confocal microscopy images. According to synthetic and real data, dilute or crowded, particles can be detected correctly without assumption on their sizes, even when particle diameters differ by large factors. Moreover the size of each particle can be estimated within a few percent error (less than $0.3\%$ if the diameter is larger than \unit{5}{px}).
