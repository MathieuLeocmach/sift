  abstract = {Crystal nucleation is a much-studied phenomenon, yet the rate at which
	it occurs remains difficult to predict. Small crystal nuclei form
	spontaneously in supersaturated solutions, but unless their size
	exceeds a critical value--the so-called critical nucleus--they will
	re-dissolve rather than grow. It is this rate-limiting step that
	has proved difficult to probe experimentally. The crystal nucleation
	rate depends on Pcrit, the (very small) probability that a critical
	nucleus forms spontaneously, and on a kinetic factor (kappa) that
	measures the rate at which critical nuclei subsequently grow. Given
	the absence of a priori knowledge of either quantity, classical nucleation
	theory is commonly used to analyse crystal nucleation experiments,
	with the unconstrained parameters adjusted to fit the observations.
	This approach yields no 'first principles' prediction of absolute
	nucleation rates. Here we approach the problem from a different angle,
	simulating the nucleation process in a suspension of hard colloidal
	spheres, to obtain quantitative numerical predictions of the crystal
	nucleation rate. We find large discrepancies between the computed
	nucleation rates and those deduced from experiments: the best experimental
	estimates of Pcrit seem to be too large by several orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Understanding glass formation is a challenge, because the existence
	of a true glass state, distinct from liquid and solid, remains elusive:
	Glasses are liquids that have become too viscous to flow. An old
	idea, as yet unproven experimentally, is that the dynamics becomes
	sluggish as the glass transition approaches, because increasingly
	larger regions of the material have to move simultaneously to allow
	flow. We introduce new multipoint dynamical susceptibilities to estimate
	quantitatively the size of these regions and provide direct experimental
	evidence that the glass formation of molecular liquids and colloidal
	suspensions is accompanied by growing dynamic correlation length
	scales.},

  abstract = {Crystallization is one of the most fundamental nonequilibrium phenomena
	universal to a variety of materials. It has so far been assumed that
	a supercooled liquid is in a "homogeneous disordered state" before
	crystallization. Contrary to this common belief, we reveal that a
	supercooled colloidal liquid is actually not homogeneous, but has
	transient medium-range structural order. We find that nucleation
	preferentially takes place in regions of high structural order via
	wetting effects, which reduce the crystal-liquid interfacial energy
	significantly and thus promotes crystal nucleation. This novel scenario
	provides a clue to solving a long-standing mystery concerning a large
	discrepancy between the rigorous numerical estimation of the nucleation
	rate on the basis of the classical nucleation theory and the experimentally
	observed ones. Our finding may shed light not only on the mechanism
	of crystal nucleation, but also on the fundamental nature of a supercooled
	liquid state.},

  abstract = {Often experimentalists study colloidal suspensions that are nominally
	monodisperse. In reality these samples have a polydispersity of 4-10\%.
	At the level of an individual particle, the consequences of this
	polydispersity are unknown as it is difficult to measure an individual
	particle size from microscopy. We propose a general method to estimate
	individual particle radii within a moderately concentrated colloidal
	suspension observed with confocal microscopy. We confirm the validity
	of our method by numerical simulations of four major systems: random
	close packing, colloidal gels, nominally monodisperse dense samples,
	and nominally binary dense samples. We then apply our method to experimental
	data, and demonstrate the utility of this method with results from
	four case studies. In the first, we demonstrate that we can recover
	the full particle size distribution \{$\backslash$it in situ\}. In
	the second, we show that accounting for particle size leads to more
	accurate structural information in a random close packed sample.
	In the third, we show that crystal nucleation occurs in locally monodisperse
	regions. In the fourth, we show that particle mobility in a dense
	sample is correlated to the local volume fraction.},

	capabilities by target-locking freely-diffusing clusters of attractive
	colloidal particles, and activelytransported quantum dots (QDs) endocytosed
	into live cells free to move in three dimensions, for several hours.
	During this time, both the colloidal clusters and live cells move

@article{Zhang2007,
abstract = {We comprehensively study the least-squares Gaussian approximations of the diffraction-limited 2D-3D paraxial-nonparaxial point-spread functions (PSFs) of the wide field fluorescence microscope (WFFM), the laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM), and the disk scanning confocal microscope (DSCM). The PSFs are expressed using the Debye integral. Under an L(infinity) constraint imposing peak matching, optimal and near-optimal Gaussian parameters are derived for the PSFs. With an L1 constraint imposing energy conservation, an optimal Gaussian parameter is derived for the 2D paraxial WFFM PSF. We found that (1) the 2D approximations are all very accurate; (2) no accurate Gaussian approximation exists for 3D WFFM PSFs; and (3) with typical pinhole sizes, the 3D approximations are accurate for the DSCM and nearly perfect for the LSCM. All the Gaussian parameters derived in this study are in explicit analytical form, allowing their direct use in practical applications.},
