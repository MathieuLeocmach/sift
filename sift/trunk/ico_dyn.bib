  abstract = {Understanding glass formation is a challenge, because the existence
	of a true glass state, distinct from liquid and solid, remains elusive:
	Glasses are liquids that have become too viscous to flow. An old
	idea, as yet unproven experimentally, is that the dynamics becomes
	sluggish as the glass transition approaches, because increasingly
	larger regions of the material have to move simultaneously to allow
	flow. We introduce new multipoint dynamical susceptibilities to estimate
	quantitatively the size of these regions and provide direct experimental
	evidence that the glass formation of molecular liquids and colloidal
	suspensions is accompanied by growing dynamic correlation length
	scales.},

  abstract = {Often experimentalists study colloidal suspensions that are nominally
	monodisperse. In reality these samples have a polydispersity of 4-10\%.
	At the level of an individual particle, the consequences of this
	polydispersity are unknown as it is difficult to measure an individual
	particle size from microscopy. We propose a general method to estimate
	individual particle radii within a moderately concentrated colloidal
	suspension observed with confocal microscopy. We confirm the validity
	of our method by numerical simulations of four major systems: random
	close packing, colloidal gels, nominally monodisperse dense samples,
	and nominally binary dense samples. We then apply our method to experimental
	data, and demonstrate the utility of this method with results from
	four case studies. In the first, we demonstrate that we can recover
	the full particle size distribution \{$\backslash$it in situ\}. In
	the second, we show that accounting for particle size leads to more
	accurate structural information in a random close packed sample.
	In the third, we show that crystal nucleation occurs in locally monodisperse
	regions. In the fourth, we show that particle mobility in a dense
	sample is correlated to the local volume fraction.},

  abstract = {We present a real-time target-locking confocal microscope that follows
	an object moving along an arbitrary path, even as it simultaneously
	changes its shape, size and orientation. This Target-locking Acquisition
	with Realtime Confocal (TARC) microscopy system integrates fast image
	processing and rapid image acquisition using a Nipkow spinning-disk
	confocal microscope. The system acquires a 3D stack of images, performs
	a full structural analysis to locate a feature of interest, moves
	the sample in response, and then collects the next 3D image stack.
	In this way, data collection is dynamically adjusted to keep a moving
	object centered in the field of view. We demonstrate the system's
	capabilities by target-locking freely-diffusing clusters of attractive
	colloidal particles, and activelytransported quantum dots (QDs) endocytosed
	into live cells free to move in three dimensions, for several hours.
	During this time, both the colloidal clusters and live cells move
	distances several times the length of the imaging volume.},

  abstract = {Hard-sphere colloids are popular as models for testing fundamental
	theories in condensed matter and statistical physics, from crystal
	nucleation to the glass transition. A single parameter, the volume
	fraction (phi), characterizes an ideal, monodisperse hard-sphere
	suspension. In comparing experiments with theories and simulation,
	researchers to date have paid little attention to likely uncertainties
	in experimentally-quoted phi values. We critically review the experimental
	measurement of phi in hard-sphere colloids, and show that while statistical
	uncertainties in comparing relative values of phi can be as low as
	0.0001, systematic errors of 3-6\% are probably unavoidable. The
	consequences of this are illustrated by way of a case study comparing
	literature data sets on hard-sphere viscosity and diffusion.},
