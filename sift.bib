  number = {6823},
  month = feb,
  abstract = {Crystal nucleation is a much-studied phenomenon, yet the rate at which
	it occurs remains difficult to predict. Small crystal nuclei form
	spontaneously in supersaturated solutions, but unless their size
	exceeds a critical value--the so-called critical nucleus--they will
	re-dissolve rather than grow. It is this rate-limiting step that
	has proved difficult to probe experimentally. The crystal nucleation
	rate depends on Pcrit, the (very small) probability that a critical
	nucleus forms spontaneously, and on a kinetic factor (kappa) that
	measures the rate at which critical nuclei subsequently grow. Given
	the absence of a priori knowledge of either quantity, classical nucleation
	theory is commonly used to analyse crystal nucleation experiments,
	with the unconstrained parameters adjusted to fit the observations.
	This approach yields no 'first principles' prediction of absolute
	nucleation rates. Here we approach the problem from a different angle,
	simulating the nucleation process in a suspension of hard colloidal
	spheres, to obtain quantitative numerical predictions of the crystal
	nucleation rate. We find large discrepancies between the computed
	nucleation rates and those deduced from experiments: the best experimental
	estimates of Pcrit seem to be too large by several orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {We explore the limits of digital video microscopy which is established as a standard method in physics, chemistry and biology. At particle distances close to contact we observe small but systematic deviations between the optically measured and the real particle distances. This difference is caused by the overlap of the optical images between neighboring particles. Exemplarily we discuss the consequences of this effect on pair potential measurements of charge stabilized colloids in confined geometries.},

	of a true glass state, distinct from liquid and solid, remains elusive:
	Glasses are liquids that have become too viscous to flow. An old
	idea, as yet unproven experimentally, is that the dynamics becomes
	sluggish as the glass transition approaches, because increasingly
	larger regions of the material have to move simultaneously to allow
	flow. We introduce new multipoint dynamical susceptibilities to estimate
	quantitatively the size of these regions and provide direct experimental
	evidence that the glass formation of molecular liquids and colloidal
	suspensions is accompanied by growing dynamic correlation length
	scales.},

	the most reliable coordinates from these images. We discuss in depth
	the accuracy of the coordinates, which is sensitive to the details
	of the colloidal system and the imaging system. Moreover, this accuracy
	can vary between particles, particularly in dense systems. We introduce
	a previously unreported error estimate and use it to develop an iterative
	method for finding particle coordinates. This individual-particle
	accuracy assessment also allows comparison between particle locations
	obtained from different experiments. Though aimed primarily at confocal
	microscopy studies of colloidal systems, the methods outlined here
	should transfer readily to many other feature extraction problems,

	universal to a variety of materials. It has so far been assumed that
	a supercooled liquid is in a "homogeneous disordered state" before
	crystallization. Contrary to this common belief, we reveal that a
	supercooled colloidal liquid is actually not homogeneous, but has
	transient medium-range structural order. We find that nucleation
	preferentially takes place in regions of high structural order via
	wetting effects, which reduce the crystal-liquid interfacial energy
	significantly and thus promotes crystal nucleation. This novel scenario
	provides a clue to solving a long-standing mystery concerning a large
	discrepancy between the rigorous numerical estimation of the nucleation
	rate on the basis of the classical nucleation theory and the experimentally
	observed ones. Our finding may shed light not only on the mechanism
	of crystal nucleation, but also on the fundamental nature of a supercooled

  abstract = {Often experimentalists study colloidal suspensions that are nominally

	At the level of an individual particle, the consequences of this
	polydispersity are unknown as it is difficult to measure an individual
	particle size from microscopy. We propose a general method to estimate
	individual particle radii within a moderately concentrated colloidal
	suspension observed with confocal microscopy. We confirm the validity
	of our method by numerical simulations of four major systems: random
	close packing, colloidal gels, nominally monodisperse dense samples,
	and nominally binary dense samples. We then apply our method to experimental
	data, and demonstrate the utility of this method with results from
	four case studies. In the first, we demonstrate that we can recover
	the full particle size distribution \{$\backslash$it in situ\}. In
	the second, we show that accounting for particle size leads to more
	accurate structural information in a random close packed sample.
	In the third, we show that crystal nucleation occurs in locally monodisperse
	regions. In the fourth, we show that particle mobility in a dense
	sample is correlated to the local volume fraction.},

	theories in condensed matter and statistical physics, from crystal
	nucleation to the glass transition. A single parameter, the volume
	fraction (phi), characterizes an ideal, monodisperse hard-sphere
	suspension. In comparing experiments with theories and simulation,
	researchers to date have paid little attention to likely uncertainties
	in experimentally-quoted phi values. We critically review the experimental
	measurement of phi in hard-sphere colloids, and show that while statistical
	uncertainties in comparing relative values of phi can be as low as
	0.0001, systematic errors of 3-6\% are probably unavoidable. The
	consequences of this are illustrated by way of a case study comparing
	literature data sets on hard-sphere viscosity and diffusion.},

	dynamics simulations of assemblies of hard spheres, addressing crystallization
	and glass formation. The simulations cover wide ranges of polydispersity
	s (standard deviation of the particle size distribution divided by
	its mean) and particle concentration. No crystallization is observed
	for s>0.07. For 0.02<s<0.07, we find that increasing the polydispersity
	at a given concentration slows down crystal nucleation. The main
	effect here is that polydispersity reduces the supersaturation since
	it tends to stabilize the fluid but to destabilize the crystal. At
	a given polydispersity (<0.07), we find three regimes of nucleation:
	standard nucleation and growth at concentrations in and slightly
	above the coexistence region; 'spinodal nucleation', where the free-energy
	barrier to nucleation appears to be negligible, at intermediate concentrations;
	and, at the highest concentrations, a new mechanism, still to be
	fully understood, which only requires small rearrangement of the
	particle positions. The cross-over between the second and third regimes
	occurs at a concentration, approximately 58 per cent by volume, where
	the colloid experiments show a marked change in the nature of the
	crystals formed and the particle dynamics indicate an 'ideal' glass
	transition.},

	suspensions of colloidal hard spheres for three polydispersities
	between 4.8\% and 5.8\%, over a range of volume fractions from near
	freezing to near the glass transition. From these results, we identify
	four stages in the crystallization process: (i) an induction stage
	where large numbers of precursor structures are observed, (ii) a
	conversion stage as precursors are converted to close packed structures,
	(iii) a nucleation stage, and (iv) a ripening stage. It is found
	that the behavior is qualitatively different for volume fractions
	below or above the melting volume fraction. The main effect of increasing
	polydispersity is to increase the duration of the induction stage,
	due to the requirement for local fractionation of particles of larger
	or smaller than average size. Near the glass transition, the nucleation
	process is entirely frustrated, and the sample is locked into a compressed
	crystal precursor structure. Interestingly, neither polydispersity
	nor volume fraction significantly influences the precursor stage,
	suggesting that the crystal precursors are present in all solidifying
	samples. We speculate that these precursors are related to the dynamical
	heterogeneities observed in a number of dynamical studies.},

  abstract = {We comprehensively study the least-squares Gaussian approximations
	of the diffraction-limited 2D-3D paraxial-nonparaxial point-spread
	functions (PSFs) of the wide field fluorescence microscope (WFFM),
	the laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM), and the disk scanning
	confocal microscope (DSCM). The PSFs are expressed using the Debye
	integral. Under an L(infinity) constraint imposing peak matching,
	optimal and near-optimal Gaussian parameters are derived for the
	PSFs. With an L1 constraint imposing energy conservation, an optimal
	Gaussian parameter is derived for the 2D paraxial WFFM PSF. We found
	that (1) the 2D approximations are all very accurate; (2) no accurate
	Gaussian approximation exists for 3D WFFM PSFs; and (3) with typical
	pinhole sizes, the 3D approximations are accurate for the DSCM and
	nearly perfect for the LSCM. All the Gaussian parameters derived
	in this study are in explicit analytical form, allowing their direct
	use in practical applications.},
