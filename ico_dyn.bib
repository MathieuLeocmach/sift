  abstract = {Crystal nucleation is a much-studied phenomenon, yet the rate at which
	it occurs remains difficult to predict. Small crystal nuclei form
	spontaneously in supersaturated solutions, but unless their size
	exceeds a critical value--the so-called critical nucleus--they will
	re-dissolve rather than grow. It is this rate-limiting step that
	has proved difficult to probe experimentally. The crystal nucleation
	rate depends on Pcrit, the (very small) probability that a critical
	nucleus forms spontaneously, and on a kinetic factor (kappa) that
	measures the rate at which critical nuclei subsequently grow. Given
	the absence of a priori knowledge of either quantity, classical nucleation
	theory is commonly used to analyse crystal nucleation experiments,
	with the unconstrained parameters adjusted to fit the observations.
	This approach yields no 'first principles' prediction of absolute
	nucleation rates. Here we approach the problem from a different angle,
	simulating the nucleation process in a suspension of hard colloidal
	spheres, to obtain quantitative numerical predictions of the crystal
	nucleation rate. We find large discrepancies between the computed
	nucleation rates and those deduced from experiments: the best experimental
	estimates of Pcrit seem to be too large by several orders of magnitude.},

	of a true glass state, distinct from liquid and solid, remains elusive:
	Glasses are liquids that have become too viscous to flow. An old
	idea, as yet unproven experimentally, is that the dynamics becomes
	sluggish as the glass transition approaches, because increasingly
	larger regions of the material have to move simultaneously to allow
	flow. We introduce new multipoint dynamical susceptibilities to estimate
	quantitatively the size of these regions and provide direct experimental
	evidence that the glass formation of molecular liquids and colloidal
	suspensions is accompanied by growing dynamic correlation length
	scales.},

@article{Brandenburg2007,
abstract = {What could be a better way to study virus trafficking than 'miniaturizing oneself' and 'taking a ride with the virus particle' on its journey into the cell? Single-virus tracking in living cells potentially provides us with the means to visualize the virus journey. This approach allows us to follow the fate of individual virus particles and monitor dynamic interactions between viruses and cellular structures, revealing previously unobservable infection steps. The entry, trafficking and egress mechanisms of various animal viruses have been elucidated using this method. The combination of single-virus trafficking with systems approaches and state-of-the-art imaging technologies should prove exciting in the future.},

@article{Jenkins2008,
abstract = {Over the last decade, the light microscope has become increasingly useful as a quantitative tool for studying colloidal systems. The ability to obtain particle coordinates in bulk samples from micrographs is particularly appealing. In this paper we review and extend methods for optimal image formation of colloidal samples, which is vital for particle coordinates of the highest accuracy, and for extracting the most reliable coordinates from these images. We discuss in depth the accuracy of the coordinates, which is sensitive to the details of the colloidal system and the imaging system. Moreover, this accuracy can vary between particles, particularly in dense systems. We introduce a previously unreported error estimate and use it to develop an iterative method for finding particle coordinates. This individual-particle accuracy assessment also allows comparison between particle locations obtained from different experiments. Though aimed primarily at confocal microscopy studies of colloidal systems, the methods outlined here should transfer readily to many other feature extraction problems, especially where features may overlap one another.},

	universal to a variety of materials. It has so far been assumed that
	a supercooled liquid is in a "homogeneous disordered state" before
	crystallization. Contrary to this common belief, we reveal that a
	supercooled colloidal liquid is actually not homogeneous, but has
	transient medium-range structural order. We find that nucleation
	preferentially takes place in regions of high structural order via
	wetting effects, which reduce the crystal-liquid interfacial energy
	significantly and thus promotes crystal nucleation. This novel scenario
	provides a clue to solving a long-standing mystery concerning a large
	discrepancy between the rigorous numerical estimation of the nucleation
	rate on the basis of the classical nucleation theory and the experimentally
	observed ones. Our finding may shed light not only on the mechanism
	of crystal nucleation, but also on the fundamental nature of a supercooled

	At the level of an individual particle, the consequences of this
	polydispersity are unknown as it is difficult to measure an individual

	individual particle radii within a moderately concentrated colloidal
	suspension observed with confocal microscopy. We confirm the validity
	of our method by numerical simulations of four major systems: random
	close packing, colloidal gels, nominally monodisperse dense samples,
	and nominally binary dense samples. We then apply our method to experimental
	data, and demonstrate the utility of this method with results from
	four case studies. In the first, we demonstrate that we can recover
	the full particle size distribution \{$\backslash$it in situ\}. In
	the second, we show that accounting for particle size leads to more
	accurate structural information in a random close packed sample.
	In the third, we show that crystal nucleation occurs in locally monodisperse
	regions. In the fourth, we show that particle mobility in a dense
	sample is correlated to the local volume fraction.},

abstract = {Living organisms perform and control complex behaviours by using webs of chemical reactions organized in precise networks. This powerful system concept, which is at the very core of biology, has recently become a new foundation for bioengineering. Remarkably, however, it is still extremely difficult to rationally create such network architectures in artificial, non-living and well-controlled settings. We introduce here a method for such a purpose, on the basis of standard DNA biochemistry. This approach is demonstrated by assembling de novo an efficient chemical oscillator: we encode the wiring of the corresponding network in the sequence of small DNA templates and obtain the predicted dynamics. Our results show that the rational cascading of standard elements opens the possibility to implement complex behaviours in vitro. Because of the simple and well-controlled environment, the corresponding chemical network is easily amenable to quantitative mathematical analysis. These synthetic systems may thus accelerate our understanding of the underlying principles of biological dynamic modules.},

	theories in condensed matter and statistical physics, from crystal
	nucleation to the glass transition. A single parameter, the volume
	fraction (phi), characterizes an ideal, monodisperse hard-sphere
	suspension. In comparing experiments with theories and simulation,
	researchers to date have paid little attention to likely uncertainties
	in experimentally-quoted phi values. We critically review the experimental
	measurement of phi in hard-sphere colloids, and show that while statistical
	uncertainties in comparing relative values of phi can be as low as
	0.0001, systematic errors of 3-6\% are probably unavoidable. The
	consequences of this are illustrated by way of a case study comparing
	literature data sets on hard-sphere viscosity and diffusion.},

abstract = {To crystallize, spherical colloidal particles must not have too broad a spread of size (or polydispersity). Here it is pointed out that the findings of recent calculations and computer simulations concerning the effects of polydispersity on the crystallization of hard spherical particles are simplified considerably if cast in terms of a universal index of polydispersity. A simple model is shown to give a similar result. We find the crystallization of such a colloidal suspension is suppressed when the polydispersity, defined as the standard deviation of the particle size distribution divided by its mean, exceeds a critical value which lies in the range 6 to 12 \% .},

@article{pusey2009hard,
abstract = {Motivated by old experiments on colloidal suspensions, we report molecular dynamics simulations of assemblies of hard spheres, addressing crystallization and glass formation. The simulations cover wide ranges of polydispersity s (standard deviation of the particle size distribution divided by its mean) and particle concentration. No crystallization is observed for s>0.07. For 0.02<s<0.07, we find that increasing the polydispersity at a given concentration slows down crystal nucleation. The main effect here is that polydispersity reduces the supersaturation since it tends to stabilize the fluid but to destabilize the crystal. At a given polydispersity (<0.07), we find three regimes of nucleation: standard nucleation and growth at concentrations in and slightly above the coexistence region; 'spinodal nucleation', where the free-energy barrier to nucleation appears to be negligible, at intermediate concentrations; and, at the highest concentrations, a new mechanism, still to be fully understood, which only requires small rearrangement of the particle positions. The cross-over between the second and third regimes occurs at a concentration, approximately 58 per cent by volume, where the colloid experiments show a marked change in the nature of the crystals formed and the particle dynamics indicate an 'ideal' glass transition.},

@article{Schope2007,
abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the solidification scenario in suspensions of colloidal hard spheres for three polydispersities between 4.8\% and 5.8\%, over a range of volume fractions from near freezing to near the glass transition. From these results, we identify four stages in the crystallization process: (i) an induction stage where large numbers of precursor structures are observed, (ii) a conversion stage as precursors are converted to close packed structures, (iii) a nucleation stage, and (iv) a ripening stage. It is found that the behavior is qualitatively different for volume fractions below or above the melting volume fraction. The main effect of increasing polydispersity is to increase the duration of the induction stage, due to the requirement for local fractionation of particles of larger or smaller than average size. Near the glass transition, the nucleation process is entirely frustrated, and the sample is locked into a compressed crystal precursor structure. Interestingly, neither polydispersity nor volume fraction significantly influences the precursor stage, suggesting that the crystal precursors are present in all solidifying samples. We speculate that these precursors are related to the dynamical heterogeneities observed in a number of dynamical studies.},

@article{Zhang2007,
abstract = {We comprehensively study the least-squares Gaussian approximations of the diffraction-limited 2D-3D paraxial-nonparaxial point-spread functions (PSFs) of the wide field fluorescence microscope (WFFM), the laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM), and the disk scanning confocal microscope (DSCM). The PSFs are expressed using the Debye integral. Under an L(infinity) constraint imposing peak matching, optimal and near-optimal Gaussian parameters are derived for the PSFs. With an L1 constraint imposing energy conservation, an optimal Gaussian parameter is derived for the 2D paraxial WFFM PSF. We found that (1) the 2D approximations are all very accurate; (2) no accurate Gaussian approximation exists for 3D WFFM PSFs; and (3) with typical pinhole sizes, the 3D approximations are accurate for the DSCM and nearly perfect for the LSCM. All the Gaussian parameters derived in this study are in explicit analytical form, allowing their direct use in practical applications.},
